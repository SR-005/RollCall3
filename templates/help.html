        Need help getting your event POAPs up and running? Don’t worry — this quick guide walks you through the whole process from event creation to sharing badges.
      </p>

      <h2><span class="emoji"></span> What is POAP</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>POAP</strong> stands for <strong>Proof of Attendance Protocol</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s basically a digital badge you get to prove you attended an event — kind of like a souvenir sticker, but on the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each POAP is a small collectible token stored on the blockchain. Event organizers create these badges, and attendees can claim them through special links or QR codes. They don’t cost anything, and you don’t need to know crypto to use them — you can collect them just with an email address.
      </p>
      <p>
        People use POAPs to show off what events they’ve been part of, build a record of their experiences, or even unlock community rewards later on. Think of it as a digital memory that says, “Yes, I was there!”
      </p>


      <h2><span class="emoji"></span> Step 1: Create Your Event</h2>
      <p>
        Start by entering your event details — things like the <strong>event name</strong>, <strong>description</strong>, <strong>city</strong>, <strong>country</strong>, and <strong>date range</strong>.  
        You’ll also need to add your <strong>email</strong> (for updates) and a <strong>secret code</strong> (used for POAP verification).  
        Upload a clear and fun <strong>event icon</strong> (PNG or JPG) — this will be your event’s face when the badge is minted.
      </p>
      <p class="text-muted">
        💡 Tip: The event icon works best as a square image (around 500x500px) with no text on it.
      </p>

      <h2><span class="emoji"></span> Step 2: Upload Your Attendance Report</h2>
      <p>
        Next, upload your attendance data — this could be a <strong>Zoom attendance CSV</strong>, <strong>Google Sheet export</strong>, or any similar file.  
        RollCall3 automatically processes the list to verify each participant who attended your event.
      </p>

      <h2><span class="emoji"></span> Step 3: Verify the Event</h2>
      <p>
        Once you submit the event details, RollCall3 will talk to the <strong>POAP API</strong> to confirm the event creation.  
        You’ll then get two important pieces of information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Event ID</span> – your event’s unique identifier on POAP</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Secret Code</span> – required to request mint links later</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We will be mailing you these information for safe keeping to the mail with which you created the event. You will need these information later to check the status of the claim link generation.
      </p>
      <p class="text-muted">
        ⚠️ Keep these safe — you'll need them when generating mint links or checking event status.
      </p>

      <h2><span class="emoji"></span> Step 4: Request Mint Links</h2>
      <p>
        After the event is verified, head over to the  
        <a href="https://drops.poap.xyz" target="_blank">POAP Drop Dashboard</a>.  
        Login with the email that you created the event with. You should be able to see the event in the Dashboard itself, if not just import the drop.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the Drop is imported, click the Mint Link Request button and ask for Mint Link (Number will be specified in the email that you recieved).
        Once the request is sumbitted, you can check the request status in RollCall3 itself.
      </p>
      <p class="text-muted">
         Think of these links as your digital tickets — each one is unique to a participant.
      </p>

      <h2><span class="emoji"></span> Step 5: Share the POAPs</h2>
      <p>
        Once the status of the mint links become apporved, you will see the option 'Send Links'. Click on it and RollCall3 will automatically email them to verified attendees.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s it — your attendees can now claim their well-earned POAP badges!
