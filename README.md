#  RollCall3 

As we move forward, WEB3 is becoming more and more relevant and it is high time we make the switch, but most of the people are not aware of these.
**RollCall3** is a beginner friendly platform where any Organization/Individual can register their events on chain, create mint and distribute **POAP (Proof of Attendance Protocol) badges** automatically through mail to verified candidates. Above all that, online events have a speacial surprise-they dont have to verify the people who has attended the meeting. We will sort them and automatically send their claim link via email directly to them. AS EASY AS THAT
